## Synopsis

Tiny Simple React Redux Bangla Locale Support.

## Code Example

Most of the times I just need to support only two languages (English and Bangla). For this its seems unnecessary to implement
react-intl like packages. As this package is not using Browser Intl API, thus you don't have to worry about Browser support.
It will work as it just simple javascript.

## Installation

npm install react-redux-bangla-intl --save-dev

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

`npm run test`
