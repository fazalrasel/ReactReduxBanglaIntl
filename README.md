## Synopsis

Tiny Simple React Redux Bangla Locale Support.

## Code Example

Most of the times I just need to support only two languages (English and Bangla). For this its seems unnecessary to implement
react-intl like packages. As this package is not using Browser Intl API, thus you don't have to worry about Browser support.
It will work as it just simple javascript.

## Installation

npm install react-redux-bangla-intl --save-dev

## API Reference

Will be added soon.

## Tests

`npm run test`

## Contributors

Any suggestion is welcome.
